Hello everyone. My name is Ibrahim Mohamed and I'm a 3rd year in the ECE pre-major. This is the first time I've tried to create a web page. It's been going well so far. Although I'm not sure what else to write here. The requirements say I need to write a paragraph. 
Which is at least 5 sentences right? Meaning I only have to stall a bit and fill up the space with nonsense. 
Which is exactly what I just did. Also, I nearly forgot to include a list and table (another requirement). So heres a list of my favorite fruits and a table containing some facts about me! </p>

<h2> Favorite Fruits </h2>
<ol> 
<li> Cherries </li>
<li> Plums </li>
<li> Watermelons </li>
<li> Mandarins</li>
<li> Mangoes </li>
</ol>

<h2> Facts About Me </h2>
<table border="1">
<tr align="center"> 
  <th> Potential Majors </th>
  <th> Favorite Books </th>
  <th> Favorite Hobbies </th>
</tr>

<tr align="center">
  <td> ECE </td>
  <td> The Drawing of The Three </td>
  <td> Reading Fantasy Books </td>
</tr>

<tr align="center">
  <td> CSE </td>
  <td> A Hard Day's Knight </td>
  <td> Playing Basketball </td>
</tr>

 <tr align="center">
  <td> CIS </td>
  <td> A Dance With Dragons </td>
  <td> Exploring Philosophies </td>
</tr>
</table>
