# Java-Projects
A collection of the various Software I (OSU) projects I completed using the Java programming language.
These projects are mainly intended for viewing purposes. Those who want to test the code can simply download the files and run the java programs in their Eclipse application. 

Project Descriptions:

CryptoUtilities - a Java program that implements utility methods that could be used in cryptographic computations, including one that can generate a huge number that is very likely a prime number.

Glossary - a Java program that produces a glossary in the form pf HTML files. Furthermore, there will be a top-level index which lists each term in the glossary, and separate pages for each of the terms with their definitions. Clicking on a term in the index will take you to the page for that term and its associated definition. Moreover, clicking on any term in the glossary that happens to appear in a definition will take you to the page for that term and its associated definition. Naturally, the contents of the glossary is entirely dependent on the input file. 

NaturalNumberCalculator - a Java program that uses the NaturalNumber components to develop a complete application: a natural number calculator. It functions similarly with any other calculator—except that it does exact arithmetic with natural numbers that have no explicit bounds on their values, which is unlike any other calculator you have likely seen before.

NaturalNumberRoot - a Java program that implements the root static method for NaturalNumber using the interval halving root algorithm for integer roots.

Newton - a Java program that repeatedly asks the user whether they wish to calculate a square root. Each time, if the response is "y", then the program proceeds; if it is anything else, then the program quits. Whenever it proceeds, the program will prompt the user for a number (a positive double), and then report the square root of that number to within a relative error of no more than 0.01%. The computation is done using Newton iteration.

Pseudoscience - a Java program that asks the user what constant μ should be approximated, and then asks in turn for each of the four personal numbers w, x, y, and z. The program then calculates and reports the values of the exponents a, b, c, and d that bring the de Jager formula as close as possible to μ, as well as the value of the formula (w^a)(x^b)(y^c)(z^d) and the relative error of the approximation to the nearest hundredth of one percent.

RSSReader - a Java program that asks the user for the URL of an RSS 2.0 feed and for the name of an output file including the .html extension, reads the RSS feed into an XMLTree object and then uses the information in the XMLTree object to generate a well formatted HTML page with a table of links to all the news items in the original feed.

RSSAggregator - a Java program that asks the user for the name of an XML file containing a list of URLs for RSS v2.0 feeds and for the name of an output file in which to generate an HTML page with links to the pages for the individual RSS feeds. It then reads the input XML file into an XMLTree object and then processes the list of RSS feeds from the XMLTree. For each RSS feed, the program generates an HTML page with a table of links to all the news items in the feed (just like in RSS Reader). The program also generates an HTML page with an index of links to the individual feed pages.

StringReassemblyFromFragments - a Java program that reassembles large texts based on the methodology employed in the Human Genome Project. 

XMLTreeExpressionEvaluator - a Java program that recursively evaluates arithmetic expressions represented as XMLTrees. One version of the employed method evaluates the expression with ints and the other version uses NaturalNumbers. The expressions are stored in XML format so the program can load them as XMLTrees.
